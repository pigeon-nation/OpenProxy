# OpenProxy
> This is currently not under vigourous development, as InternetKit is one of the most foremost non-private projects right now, so this will be returned to when development on the other project has cooled down a little.
## Description
### What is this?
OpenProxy is a small library that allows you to look up proxy servers, based off search criteria. You can also connect to those servers, or connect to a random one, via the python requests module.
### Overall, is this tool safe?
It depends. While the tool itself is safe (mostly), the servers you can connect to might not be. As long as you connect to servers that you trust, you are pretty safe. However, we are not affiliated with these servers in any way, and we cannot control what they do. We cannot gaurentee that they do not store information about the requests you make, nor can we gaurentee anything else related to them.
### How well does it actually work?
Upon testing, in my oppinion this tool works well most of the time on "random" mode. It really depends on wether the server you are connecting to is online or not.
### What cautionary steps should I take whilst using this tool?
Plainly put: know your server!! If you want to gaurentee 100% privacy, do your research! However, for the most part, unless sensitive data is being transmitted, you can just use any server avaliable.

Please note there are also builtin "privacy" levels you can try. However, these DO NOT GAURENTEE ANY PRIVACY. THESE ARE JUST PROVIDED BY THE SCOURCE OF THE INFORMATION.
